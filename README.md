## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio to show off your work and skills to potential employers. This website also contains contact methods, information about me and blog posts I have written. This also is to demonstrate my web development skills and a little of my design skills too.

## Features and Functionality

This website is the first I have fully programmed with accessability in mind. Making sure it passes all audit test in flying colours allowing it to be easily accessabel by anyone and helping me improve upon my site. Other features include nice animations, a completely responsive design whilst also staying stable and loading fast!

## Components

Many components were desinged to make the interactions with the website easy and memorable:

 - Home page / Landing page to welcome the user to the site
 - About section containing information about myself
 - Projects section to see my past work
 - Skills section to show off my software and soft skills
 - Resume page to easily view and download it
 - Contacts page to easily link to my socials
 - Blog page to link to blog posts I have created
 - Nav bar allows users to access the menu and keeps my logo at the top
 - Shape background animations
 - Menu to allow users to navigate and see where they are easily

## Target Audience

The target audience for my portfolio website is future / potential employees. This website allows them to easily see an overview of everything I have done and am capable of in one place whilst also giving them easy methods of contact.

## Design & Development

My design and development process first involved myself creating a moodboard of all websites / themes and colours I enjoyed and would like to base my portfolio off.

I then also browsed portfolio and great website examples across the web to figure out what I needed to include. I decided to create these pages to help space out my content whilst also filling the assessment requirements:
- index.html
- about.html
- projects.html
- skills.html
- blog.html
- resume.html
- contact.html


and also 4 other pages for each article included.
(Article(1,2,3 & 4).html

I then made my way onto a wireframe concept where I planned out my initial pages and how I would like them to look and where I would like to position everything on both desktop and mobile. Whilst also keeping responsiveness in mind.

I then created better versions of these in invision studio to then complete colours and have a more concrete design to work off.
