## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio to show off your work and skills to potential employers. This website also contains contact methods, information about me and blog posts I have written. This also is to demonstrate my web development skills and a little of my design skills too.

## Features and Functionality

This website is the first I have fully programmed with accessability in mind. Making sure it passes all audit test in flying colours allowing it to be easily accessabel by anyone and helping me improve upon my site. Other features include nice animations, a completely responsive design whilst also staying stable and loading fast!

## Components

Many components were desinged to make the interactions with the website easy and memorable:

- Nav bar allows users to access the menu and keeps my logo at the top
 - Shape background animations
 - Menu to allow users to navigate and see where they are easily
 - Header Section
- Social icons / buttons
 - Skills and Projects Hover items
 - Blog preview block to link to blog posts I have created

## Target Audience

The target audience for my portfolio website is future / potential employees. This website allows them to easily see an overview of everything I have done and am capable of in one place whilst also giving them easy methods of contact.

## Design & Development

My design and development process first involved myself creating a moodboard of all websites / themes and colours I enjoyed and would like to base my portfolio off.

I then also browsed portfolio and great website examples across the web to figure out what I needed to include. I decided to create these pages to help space out my content whilst also filling the assessment requirements:
- index.html
- about.html
- projects.html
- skills.html
- blog.html
- resume.html
- contact.html


and also 4 other pages for each article included.
(Article(1,2,3 & 4).html

I then made my way onto a wireframe concept where I planned out my initial pages and how I would like them to look and where I would like to position everything on both desktop and mobile. Whilst also keeping responsiveness in mind.

I then created better versions of these in invision studio to then complete colours and have a more concrete design to work off.

### Development

From here I aimed to implement a skeleton version of the site with only layout elements being positioned on the pages.

This would help with implementing accessible features, clean code and force me to stick to the styling and layout that was designed.

Unfortunately, it didn’t really turn out the way I was hoping. I discovered things weren’t working the way I had planned so I had to do a bit of improvising.

I struggled to visualise the effects my improvisation was having on the whole site so I ended up jumping into styling before completely laying out the site and I think the project suffered for it. My code isn’t particularly clean, the website isn’t as accessible as I believe it should be and the development process was for less efficient if I had stuck to the original plan.

### [](https://github.com/BenUlcoq/BenUlcoq.github.io#content-generation-and-styling)Content Generation and Styling

Outside of the improvisation, the content generation and styling was fairly smooth sailing. The largest problems faced were to do with implementing performance improvements, SEO and accessibility features.

However, the animations were quite tricky to get right. I spent a significant amount of time trying to get the animations working perfectly as I felt it was a core part of the user experience.

### [](https://github.com/BenUlcoq/BenUlcoq.github.io#review)Review

Upon review of the website design and source code there were a number of small bugs and improvements that I found and implemented.

The largest area where I failed to reach a level I was happy with was accessibility. The cards I designed are accessible but the functionality is not completely friendly to all users which is a problem. If I had more time I would implement a better solution here. Preferably though, I would like to go back and restart the development process with accessibility higher on the list of priority.

## Principles and Engagement

From the very begining I had the idea that my website had to be stylised and unique. Something that would stick in your memory and stand out from others. 
Through my moodboarding process I saw many simple styles but with bright bursts of colour or patterns to grab the attention and really show that less is more.

I really liked the idea of using key colours in a lower tone and developed my colour pallete from there. I also made sure to color blind test my colour choices for accessability of the website.

I spent a lot of tim in the planning phase to make sure I was happy with it and could follow it almost like a set of instructions. Each page has its own style but still flow together and blend together in a nice overall theme.
Each part was thought out to be functional, accessable and direct whilst also keeping to my minimal style and theme I had crafted.

### The Nav Bar 
Was a absolute seciton that would stick to the top even when scrolling and display my name and logo on the left and keep the menu on the right. Whilst keeping distinct with a nice white gradient behind.

### Hamburger Menu 
The menu opens up with a nice animation and is big and easy to read. The page you are currently on is clearly underlines and makes site navigation very easy.

### Social Icons
The social Icons are large and easy to see what they are. They open the links in another tab and use the no refer tag to stop potential cookie tracking. Giving the website a better best pratcice score.

### Skill and Project Icons
These icons do an animation on a hover or click and reveal more info. Making the page very minimalistic by there only being icons until the text is revealed.

### Shapes & Animations
The shapes add splashes of colour and contrast to each page and are animated to grab the users attention. These are rpeated through the entirety of the website.

### Blog Pannels
The Blog pannels are simple too and reveal their titles and a read now button on reach click / hover.
